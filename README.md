# Project overview
This is a smart solution to control home appliances through two options :
* Web server through HTML page.
* Mobile app through UDP protocol.

# Features
* Each device can control up to 5 appliances.
* Unlimited number of devices can be installed as they connect with eachother over udp protocol.
* Each device can connect to a local area network (LAN) in station mode such as home wifi router and can generate its own LAN network in access point mode.
* The devices can be controlled from anywhere in the world through **static IP** address as long as they're connected to the internet.
* You can reboot, reset to defaults, change mode to ST or AP mode, change SSID & PW of the networks and change the IP address all from the mobile app.
